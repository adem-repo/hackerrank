A left rotation operation on an array of size n shifts each of the array's elements 1 unit to the left. For example, if 2 left rotations are performed on array <pre>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</pre> then the array would become <pre>[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]</pre>

Given an array of  integers and a number, , perform  left rotations on the array. Then print the updated array as a single line of space-separated integers.

Print a single line of n space-separated integers denoting the final state of the array after performing d left rotations.
